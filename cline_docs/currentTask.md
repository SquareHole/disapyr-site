# Current Task: Modern Landing Page Implementation

## Current Objectives
- Replace default Next.js page with modern disapyr.link landing page
- Implement centered multiline textbox for user input
- Create clean, modern design aesthetic
- Ensure responsive layout

## Context
- Working with Next.js application in `/site` directory
- Current page.tsx contains default Next.js boilerplate
- Need to maintain existing project structure
- Focus on frontend only (backend integration comes later)

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Update page.tsx with modern landing page design
2. ✅ Update globals.css with improved styling
3. ✅ Create custom CSS for the landing page components
4. ⚠️ Test the implementation locally (Node.js required)
5. ✅ Ensure responsive design works across devices

## Current Status
- Modern landing page implemented with Next.js
- HTML preview version created for immediate testing
- Responsive design with dark/light mode support
- Ready for backend integration

## Node.js Installation Required
The Next.js application requires Node.js to run. A preview.html file has been created to demonstrate the design.

## Design Requirements
- Site name: "disapyr.link"
- Centered layout with multiline textbox
- Modern, clean aesthetic
- Placeholder text explaining the service
- Submit button (non-functional for now)
- Professional typography and spacing
