# Current Task: Backend Integration - Netlify Functions

## Current Objectives
- ✅ Implement Netlify function for secret retrieval from Neon Postgres database
- ✅ Implement Netlify function for secret creation and storage
- ✅ Integrate frontend with backend API
- ✅ Add encryption for secrets at rest
- ✅ Implement secure deletion after retrieval
- Set up environment variables for database connection and encryption
- Test the functions locally and in production

## Context
- Working with Next.js application in `/site` directory
- Modern landing page already implemented
- Added Netlify functions for backend functionality
- Using Neon Postgres database for secret storage

## Completed Steps
1. ✅ Created Netlify functions directory structure
2. ✅ Installed required dependencies (@netlify/neon, @netlify/functions)
3. ✅ Implemented getSecret.js function with:
   - Key-based secret retrieval
   - Retrieved_at timestamp validation
   - Expiration checking
   - Automatic timestamp updates
4. ✅ Implemented createSecret.js function with:
   - UUID key generation
   - Secret storage with 21-day expiration
   - Input validation and error handling
5. ✅ Updated frontend (page.tsx) with:
   - API integration for secret creation
   - Success/error state management
   - Link display and copy functionality
   - Responsive UI for generated links
6. ✅ Added CSS styles for new UI components
7. ✅ Created secret viewing page (/secret/[key]) with:
   - Dynamic route handling
   - Secret retrieval and display
   - One-time access confirmation
   - Error handling for expired/missing secrets
   - Copy functionality and user guidance
8. ✅ Implemented security enhancements:
   - AES-256-GCM encryption for secrets at rest
   - Secure key derivation using scrypt
   - Automatic secret deletion after retrieval
   - Environment-based encryption key management
9. ✅ Updated netlify.toml configuration
10. ✅ Updated comprehensive documentation with security features

## Next Steps
1. Set up NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL environment variable
2. Test the functions locally with Netlify CLI
3. Deploy to Netlify and test in production
4. ✅ Create secret viewing page (/secret/[key] route)
5. Test end-to-end functionality

## Current Status
- Full backend functionality implemented (create + retrieve)
- Frontend fully integrated with backend APIs
- Modern UI with success states and error handling
- Documentation complete for setup and testing
- Ready for environment variable configuration and deployment

## Function Details
- **Create Endpoint**: `POST /.netlify/functions/createSecret`
- **Retrieve Endpoint**: `GET /.netlify/functions/getSecret?key=SECRET_KEY`
- **Features**: One-time retrieval, 21-day expiration, UUID keys, full validation
- **Database**: Neon Postgres with secrets table

## Testing Requirements
- Environment variable setup (NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL)
- Test data in database
- Netlify CLI for local testing
