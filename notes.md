## Code Review and Improvement Suggestions

### Frontend (`page.tsx` and `secret/[key]/page.tsx`):

*   **Component Structure:** The main page (`page.tsx`) and the secret viewing page (`secret/[key]/page.tsx`) share a lot of similar layout and styling. This could be refactored to use a shared layout component to reduce code duplication.
*   **State Management:** For a simple application like this, `useState` is fine. However, for more complex applications, a state management library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit could be beneficial.
*   **Error Handling:** The error handling is basic. It could be improved by providing more specific error messages to the user based on the error type.
*   **Accessibility:** I'd recommend a review of the HTML structure and ARIA attributes to ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities.

### Backend (`createSecret.js` and `getSecret.js`):

*   **Security:**
    *   The `scryptSync` function is used to derive the encryption key. This is a good choice, but the salt is hardcoded (`'disapyr-salt'`). A unique, randomly generated salt should be used for each secret and stored with it in the database. This would significantly improve security.
    *   The `retrieved_at` field is updated, and the secret is set to `NULL` after retrieval. This is good, but a more robust approach would be to delete the row from the database entirely.
*   **Validation:** The validation is decent, but it could be more robust. For example, the `expiryDays` could be more strictly validated on the backend.
*   **Code Structure:** The Netlify functions are self-contained, which is good. However, the `encryptSecret` and `decryptSecret` functions could be moved to a shared utility file to avoid code duplication if more functions were to be added in the future.
*   **Dependencies:** The `crypto` module is a built-in Node.js module, which is good. The `@netlify/neon` package is used for database access, which is also fine.

### Overall Suggestions:

1.  **Improve Encryption:** The most critical improvement is to use a unique salt for each secret.
2.  **Refactor Frontend:** Create a shared layout component to reduce code duplication.
3.  **Enhance Security:** Delete secrets from the database after they are retrieved.
4.  **Improve Error Handling:** Provide more specific and user-friendly error messages.
5.  **Add Tests:** There are no tests. Adding unit tests for the backend functions and integration tests for the frontend would improve the reliability of the application.
